    feat: Add support for sound effects in scripts
    
    Introduces the ability to specify sound effects and their volumes within script lines. This enhancement allows for richer audio productions by enabling the integration of specific sound elements directly into the narrative flow.
    
    Includes updates to the `types.ts` file to define the `SoundEffect` interface and add `soundEffect` and `soundEffectVolume` properties to `ScriptLine`.
    
    Also includes adjustments to the `ApiKeyModal` to accommodate a new `freesound` API key and adds a basic `SfxTest` component to the main application layout for future development.
