# CONTRIBUTING TO AI PODCAST STUDIO

Thank you for considering contributing! Your expertise and effort can help us build an actionable, scalable, and user-friendly AI-powered media studio.

## How to Contribute

- **Fork the repository** and branch from `main` or latest active branch
- **Write clear atomic commits** with proper PR titles: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- **Ensure tests and documentation are updated** for each new feature or major fix
- **Use Issue Templates** for bug reports and feature requests (see `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`)
- **Describe test scenario for each new feature**
- **Stay engaged in code reviews** and iterate as needed before merging

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork and branch from `main` (name: `feature/your-topic`, `fix/your-bug`, etc.)
2. Implement your changes (keep PRs focused)
3. Document changes in `README.md`, feature docs or code comments
4. Add new/updated tests if code changes behavior
5. Submit PR, reference linked issues and describe testing
6. Participate in review, respond to feedback, squash/finalize as requested

## Code Style & Standards
- TypeScript, ESLint/Prettier enforced (see project configs)
- Write readable, tested code
- UI/logic changes: include screenshots, samples or UI test plans
- Keep PR scope focused (avoid codebase-wide formatting/renames mixed with logic changes)

## Reporting Bugs or Issues
- Use the provided GitHub issue templates
- Quickly describe reproducible scenario
- Include error output, stacktrace, screenshots if relevant
- Label your issue (bug, enhancement, doc, question, etc.)

## Feature Requests
- Open an issue using the right template
- Be concise: what, why, how it improves the product
- Suggest API shapes, UX, or examples if possible

## Roadmap & Discussion
- Track major features and discussion in GitHub Discussions
- Propose RFCs for breaking/major changes (link to them as PRs)
- For architectural/deep API proposals, suggest diagrams/ecosystem impact

## Thanks for your help!
